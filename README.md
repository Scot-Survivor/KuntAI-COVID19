# KuntAI-COVID19
Part of the KuntAI project. More to come. 

## Intro

Hello KuntAI developer. Welcome to our team!" said the AI in a welcoming voice. "We are glad to see you here." "You have been carefully selected to join our team!" it continued, its tone becoming more excited as it spoke. 
"The main mission of KuntAI is we develop, train and test Artificial Intelligence models." 
The AI paused for a moment before continuing with an enthusiastic tone: 
"Of course, there is no such thing that there will always be artificial intelligence models, 
we can work on whatever we want as long as we are together :)".

KuntAI is pursuing the goal of being a leading developer and trainer for AI models. 
As the world is changing at an accelerated pace, 
there are more opportunities to create novel ways of solving problems in every field with artificial intelligence.

We develop our own AI models on various topics such as different games, 
social media interactions or fraud detection during trading. 
We train them by ourselves using data sets made available publicly from 
KuntAI server that has been pre-processed through API Gateway service (like Dropbox). 
We can also use you're public datasets if you want us to do so :) If not - we will work on some other project together ;) 

Final result is tested against known benchmarks like ImageNet classification task where each picture must be classified into.
